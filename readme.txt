Place smart HeadsUp! web forms on your pages and collect feedback from your visitors, including HTML5 screenshots, and navigation history.

== Description ==

HeadsUp! User Engagement for WordPress enables users to place web forms on their WordPress pages. HeadsUp! web forms allow WordPress users to collect structured feedback from their visitors, including the navigation history through their site, page load times delivered on their visitor's devices and HTML5 screenshots of their visitors web browser window.

Use this feedback to engage with your visitors and to build better web sites.

As a next step you might want to route this feedback data as feature requests or defects to a Scrum project manager, as service requests to a ticketing system or as sales leads to a CRM.
